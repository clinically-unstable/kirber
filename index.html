  <p>As we all know, Kirby is one of Nintendo’s mascot franchises. Even though it may not sell as well as the others, it is still beloved by many (and the sales still give enough support for HAL to continue making games). When Masahiro Sakurai left HAL, the Kirby series was in a slightly dark area of sorts (depending on your view of the games at the time). However, the Kirby series then received a new director: Shinya Kumazaki. With a new director came along a new twist... lore. Really, really deep and well-written lore. The new lore connected nearly everything in the series. Us Kirby fans LOVED the lore, and craved for more of it. With Star Allies being the most lore-heavy game to date, I decided to talk about all of Kirby lore as we know it. At least, all as of now. Lord help us when the next game releases.



    First off, let’s start with the most iconic lore characters: the ancients.
    
    The ancients, as their name implies, are people from long, long ago that are no longer around (or so we think). The ancients are iconic in the lore for being affiliated with almost everything. Let’s take a look at their history, shall we? The only planet confirmed to have been inhabited by the ancients is Halcandra, which is located in another dimension. Now, that’s not to say they didn’t inhabit Kirby’s dimension, as several of the ancients’ creations can be found there. Regardless, the ancients were highly advanced in science, as they created many legendary pieces of technology. According to Magolor, the Lor Starcutter, a ship that can traverse through space and time, was crafted by the ancients using an incredible power. He also states that they created “clockwork stars that soar the cosmos” using the same power. Many have presumed these stars to be Novas, clockwork cat faces that can grant wishes. This was seemingly proven in Kirby: Planet Robobot, where the final boss of the game, Star Dream, fused with the Access Ark, revealing it to actually be a Nova. According to Haltmann, his company analyzed the most advanced civilizations in the known universe and used blueprints they found in order to reactivate Star Dream. The Lor and the Novas were two examples of their skill in science, but they were also skilled in magic as well. Also according to Magolor, the ancients crafted “mysterious items that can bring dreams to life.” These are presumed to be the Star Rods, which power the Fountains of Dreams. Each fountain is responsible for giving every inhabitant in their respective planet good dreams. They also created the Master Crown, a crown that grants its wearer limitless power. However, the crown itself appears to be sentient, as it takes control of Magolor’s body and transforms him into a manifestation of itself. In this form, Magolor notably has an eye in his mouth. Many have thought the crown was Dark Matter because of this. While almost everyone else thought that wasn’t the case, those who said it was just might have been correct. We’ll get to that later. Anyway, those two are examples of the ancients’ skill in magic. Slightly off-topic, but since the ancients lived on Halcandra, it is likely that they made Egg Engines, and in turn, Metal General, which the Haltmann Works Company probably used the blueprints of in order to make the Security Force. The ancients also entrusted Landia, a four-headed dragon, in guarding the legendary treasures they made on that planet.
    
    
    
    However, that’s not even close to all the information about them...
    
    
    
    As Kirby Star Allies is the most lore-heavy game as of now, they wouldn’t dare to not include the ancients. As we all know, Hyness, the main antagonist of the game, dropped a lore bomb in the form of having a stroke and spouting it out at light speed. Given that the English localization butchered this lore bomb, we’ll take a look at the original Japanese version. According to Hyness, the people of his clan were powerful wielders of magic, and were friends with people who used the power of science. Hmm, sounds familiar. The people of his clan were also worshippers of a matter most dark. Anyway, one day, their science-using friends turned on them in fear of their power and banished them to the edge of the galaxy. As if that wasn’t enough, they then subsequently erased all but a sliver of their very existence from history itself. So yeah, most of them are dead. I think Hyness is like, a descendant from this sliver, but I have no idea since it’s totally unclear whether he’s the last survivor or a descendant. Anyway, he also states that his clan was responsible for stopping a galactic crisis of sorts. Why am I telling you about Hyness’s clan? Well, it’s been theorized that Hyness’s clan and these science-users WERE the ancients, and it kind of makes sense. Think of it this way, the science-users build the base of the creation (specifically the Lor and the Novas), and Hyness’s clan imbues them with the “incredible power,” in other words, magic. That would explain how the Lor can traverse space and time and how the Novas can grant wishes. The clan most likely also made the Star Rods and the FoD, which have more to do with magic than science. Now, moving on to the Master Crown. It is theorized that it has something to do with Dark Matter, right? Given that the clan were worshippers of a matter most dark, it could be possible that they made the crown using Dark Matter. That would explain why Void Termina, the final boss of Star Allies and the reincarnation of the implied ancestor of Dark Matter, uses a replica of it in his boss fight. Speaking of Void Termina, his normal self, simply known as Void, is reportedly spoken about in several books that were written by the ancients after witnessing his starlike radiance. One of these books is likely the book of legend, which basically called Void a god. This book is presumed to be written by Hyness’s clan, due to him saying that everyone else thought it was a fairytale. And so, that is all the information surrounding the ancients so far. This is...really long. Anyway, next time, we’ll be talking about our favorite one-eyed family that corrupts planets, as well as their baby-faced presumed ancestor</p>
