  <p>kirby: canonically eight inches tall. Kirby's game is 33 years old but Kirby himself is over 200 years old. He's been praised as one of the most iconic video game characters, starring in his own games and appearing in multiple others.</p>
  <p>Apparently he has his own anime and manga where he's voiced by a fifty year old woman.</p>
  <p>Kirby is named after John Kirby, Nintendo's attorney who won a lawsuit against Universal over Donkey Kong</p>
